public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
        String s1=s.nextLine();
        char s2[]=s1.toCharArray();
        String res="";
        for(int i=0;i<s2.length;i++){
            if(s2[i]>=65 && s2[i]<=90 || s2[i]>=90 && s2[i]<=122 || s2[i]==32){
            res=res+s2[i];
            }
        }
        System.out.print(res);
    }
}
